## Keyboard shortcuts
Shortcuts I frequently use: 
- Command-number (skip to a tab ex cmd 3 opens the third tab, useful when having many tabs opened)
- Command-V (paste)
- Command-C (copy)

Shortcuts I would like to start using: 
- Command-X (cut AND copy)
- Command-A (select all)
- Command-T (opens new tab)
